' This module contains several routines for capturing windows into a
' picture.  All routines have palette support.
'
' CreateBitmapPicture   - Creates a picture object from a bitmap and palette.
' CaptureWindow         - Captures any window given a window handle.
' CaptureActiveWindow   - Captures the active window on the desktop.
' CaptureForm           - Captures the entire form.
' CaptureClient         - Captures the client area of a form.
' CaptureScreen         - Captures the entire screen.
' PrintPictureToFitPage - prints any picture as big as possible on the page.
